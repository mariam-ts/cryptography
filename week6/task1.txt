How does padding_oracle determine if padding is valid?
It attempts to decrypt the ciphertext and unpad it using PKCS#7. If an exception is raised during unpadding (due to incorrect padding), it returns False; otherwise, it returns True.

What is the purpose of the IV in CBC mode?
The IV (Initialization Vector) ensures that the same plaintext encrypted multiple times results in different ciphertexts. It introduces randomness in the first blockâ€™s encryption.

Why must the ciphertext be a multiple of the block size?
AES operates on fixed-size blocks (16 bytes). CBC mode chains the blocks, so the ciphertext must be aligned to this block size for decryption to work correctly.
