TLS Communication Inspection Summary
==================================

Target: google.com
Command Used:
    openssl s_client -connect google.com:443

Certificate Chain
------------------
Level      | Subject                          | Issuer
-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------
Leaf       | CN=google.com                    | Gateway CA - Cloudflare Managed G1
Intermediate | Gateway CA - Cloudflare Managed G1 | Self-signed

Verification Error:
    Verify return code: 19 (self-signed certificate in certificate chain)

Cipher Suite
-------------
TLS Version: TLS 1.3
Cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
Key Exchange: ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)
Authentication: ECDSA
Symmetric Encryption: AES-256 in GCM mode
MAC/Hash: SHA384

Wireshark Handshake Highlights
-------------------------------
(These should be captured in screenshots in Wireshark using filter: tls.handshake)
1. Client Hello – shows supported TLS versions and cipher suites
2. Server Certificate – contains the full certificate chain
3. Key Exchange – key agreement info (part of TLS 1.3 handshake)

TLS Security Mechanisms
-------------------------
- Confidentiality: Achieved via symmetric AES-256 encryption (GCM mode)
- Integrity: Guaranteed by AEAD and MAC (SHA384)
- Authentication: Ensured via certificate chain validation
- Forward Secrecy: Enabled by ephemeral ECDH (TLS 1.3)

Summary:
---------
TLS provides end-to-end encryption, authenticity, and integrity using a combination of public-key cryptography (for key exchange and certificates) and symmetric encryption (for actual data transmission).
