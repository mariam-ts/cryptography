TLS Report

1. TLS Handshake Explanation:
   - Client Hello: proposes supported ciphers.
   - Server Hello: selects cipher and sends certificate.
   - Key exchange occurs and session keys are derived.
   - Secure encrypted communication begins.

2. MITM Protection:
   - TLS uses certificate authority chains to verify server identity.
   - The handshake fails if the certificate is invalid.
   - Public Key Infrastructure ensures authenticity.

3. HTTPS Communication:
   - TLS encrypts data during transit.
   - Prevents eavesdropping and tampering.
   - Commonly used on login pages, banking, and email.
